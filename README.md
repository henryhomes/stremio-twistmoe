# Stremio Add-on for Twist.moe

This add-on uses [Stremio Kitsu](https://github.com/henryhomes/stremio-kitsu) internally to show it's stream results next to other anime add-ons.


**Done:**

- catalog
- catalog skip
- searching
- streaming episodes


**To do:**

- catalog filters (because we get the entire db of anime periodically, it could also support filters)
